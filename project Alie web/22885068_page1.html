      <h2>Web Browser</h2>
      <div class="colorset">
        <p>A Web browser is a software application. It is used to access information on the World Wide Web. Browsers are user interaction interface. User can make a request to a server using a Brower. The server retrieves the necessary content and then displays the page on the Brower. 
            Browers are popular nowadays. Almost everyone uses a browser to search. A wide range of browsers are used such as Google, safari and Firefox, which have different styles and limitations to meet the diverse needs of users.
            Although browser hasn't been around that long, it's been updated and iterated very quickly
            Before the web browsers we knew today, there were the first browsers, which are no longer in use or have highly evolved.

                        HTML is a kind of Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used for markup Web pages, structure and give meaning to web content<br/>
                        HTML were first created by Berners-Lee in 1991. It aim to share information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers, But it haven't fully created.
                        HTML2.0 was the first officially HTML version published around 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features. 
                        In the HTML3.0 generation, a new paper of HTML are introduced, which give web desiner more power on web design. 
                        HTML4.0 was the major version which appeared in 1999. The newest version of HTML5.0 is a extension of HTML4.0, officially publised in 2012.

                CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. It is the coding language to describes how HTML elements are to be displayed and styled. If there is no CSS, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.
                <br/>
                There are three generations of CSS, but still more new function are updating on CSS3.<br/>
Css1 is published around 1996 which changes the Early browsers' style with just plain text, images and links to other hypertext pages. CSS1 allows users to set font size, align text center, set body margins, and use background color to design elements. 
<br/>Css2 is published around 1998. It adds more functions than css1 to better control the appearance and behavior of browser features.
<br/>Css3 is the newest one which refers to everything published after css2. It allows all major browsers will read and display every CSS function in the same way. Although there are no such things as css4 ,there are level 4 modules. 
Over the years, CSS and its community have grown from just stylesheets to a whole ecosystem of technologies. Bootstrap is a already coded frameworks for user to easier build web frame.

                    Javascript is a programming language for web that enables web developer to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and simplify design process. 
                    <br/>Before the creating of Javascript, there is a big expectation for web developer,amateurs and designer without a strong coding background to innovate a small and simple web programming language. Then, the idea of Mocha was born. Mocha(early name for JavaScript) was to become a scripting language for the web. It is simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers.
                    <br/>Mocha was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 when he worked at Netscape Communications Corporation (the best browser that time).
                    <br/>The prototype of Mocha was integrated into Netscape Communicator in May 1995. In short time, it was renamed to LiveScript.
                    <br/>In December 1995, Mocha/LiveScript would be renamed as JavaScript, and it would be presented as a scripting language for small client-side tasks in the browser, while Java would be promoted as a bigger, professional tool to develop rich web components.

            <p class="style">
                The first big change for JavaScript after its public release came in the form of ECMA(an industry association) standardization.
                The version 1 of ECMAScript standard Javascript was released in June 1997. It still missed important features such as regular expressions, JSON, exceptions, and important methods for builtin objects. However, It was working much better in the browser.
                ECMAScript 3 was released in December 1999 which spread far and wide.
                As development of javascript, more and more brower venders try to working on implementing its features. However，not all languges on Javascript are compatible to variety brower. Therfore, a uniform Javaascript devlopment is expected to suitable all browsers. 
                ECMAScript 6, later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, was slated to bring big changes.
